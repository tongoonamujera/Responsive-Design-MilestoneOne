# Responsive-Design-MilestoneOne

In this project, we were asked to replicate the archived version of the website The Next Web(https://perma.cc/M5ZV-Q2D6). The main goal of the project is to apply responsive design techniques so that the website behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is displayed.

Project requirements: clean code, semantic HTML. In the first milestone, we were asked to prepare the tools to develop this website and will create 4 sections using media queries such that the project fit to different screen sizes like mobile, tablet and desktop.
